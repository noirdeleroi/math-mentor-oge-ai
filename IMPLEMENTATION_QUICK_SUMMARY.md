# ✅ Phases 1-5 Implementation Complete

**Completed**: October 31, 2025 @ 17:35 UTC  
**Status**: READY FOR TESTING

---

## 🎯 What Was Implemented

### 2 Critical Fixes Added ✅

1. **Add `analysisData` to state reset** (Line 318)
   - Ensures old feedback doesn't carry to next question
   - Prevents UI stale state issues

2. **Add `course_id` to attempt creation** (Line 456)
   - Tracks which course each attempt belongs to
   - Future-proofs for multi-course support

### 8 Existing Implementations Verified ✅

- ✅ Robust scores coercion (handles strings, decimals, clamping)
- ✅ StudentSolutionCard reads from `profiles.telegram_input`
- ✅ Fire-and-forget mastery update via `handle-submission`
- ✅ Energy points award with streak multiplier
- ✅ Success toast with scores
- ✅ Error toast on update failure
- ✅ Attempt fallback if missing currentAttemptId
- ✅ Progress modal with dual progress bars
